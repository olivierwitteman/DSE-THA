%% Notes
% Note regarding current nomenclature: the symbols used to designate 
% some of the variables has changed over the course of developing this
% code. This should be fixed throughout the code, but for now:
%   - Throttle is indicated with "t", or "xi" (in some subroutines). 
%   - "phi" is the supplied power ratio.
%   - "Phi" is the shaft power ratio, although this variable is represented 
%       with "Psi" in literature (see the paper of de Vries, Brown & Vos, 
%       2018)
%   - The thrust share provided by the propulsors (which is related to Phi)
%       is indicated using "T", which is not (only) the thrust of the 
%       aircraft, but the thrust produced by the DP propulsors divided by
%       the total thrust of the aircraft. In the paper this is represented 
%      with a "Chi".
%
% Note regarding the "throttle":
%   - For powertrain architectures containing a gas turbine (conventional,
%       turboelectric, serial, parallel, PTE or SPPH), this refers to the
%       throttle setting of the gas turbine, P_gt/P_gt_available, where
%       P_gt_available is the maximum power available in the given flight
